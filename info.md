## Supported devices

At the moment, only the device I own is supported. There is a good chance that other wifi capable devices use the same API thoug. So if you own a different device, please feel free to get in touch or contribute.

| Device                 | Notes                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Ulisse 13 DCI Eco WiFi | basic functionality is implemented |

**This component will set up the following platforms.**

| Platform  | Description                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `climate` | Control of the Argoclima device. |

{% if not installed %}

## Installation

1. Click install.
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Argoclima".

{% endif %}

## Adding your device to Home Assistant

At the moment, the integration will communicate with the device locally. Cloud based communication is not supported.

### Set up WiFi

Follow the instructions provided with the device to connect it to your network. Once that is done, I highly recommend assigning it a static IP via router configuration. The integration is IP based and can not identify the device by any other means.

### Configuration

Select your device type, give it a name and enter the IP. The IP can be changed later.\
